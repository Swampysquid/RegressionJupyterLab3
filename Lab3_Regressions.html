<h1>Statistical Linear Regression</h1>
<h2>Scatterplots</h2>
<p>
Scatterplots are a way to show multiple points of data, on a case-by-case
basis, when data is contingent on 2 variables. The
Scatterplots in this project were contingent on Temperature v. Height,
Rain v. Height, Altitude v. Height, and Site v. Height. The Scatterplots
have blue dots representing a data point, with height always being the Y-axis
and the other variable being on the X-Axis.  	
</p>
<h2>Line of Best Fit</h2>
The Line of Best Fit is applied to the Scatterplots. This line is the
line of least variation from the points, therefore it fits the points best.
It is represented on the Scatterplots as a red line going through the points.

<h2>Standard Error</h2>
<p>
The Standard Error is the approximate standard deviation of a sample
of a population; it finds the difference between the values and
their mean, as a summation. It will be used in order to find the Coefficient
of Determination.
</p>
<h2>R Squared</h2>
<p>
The R Squared is the Coefficient of Determination. This is
a measure of the amount of variation in the dependent variable(height), which
can be explained by the independent variable. Essentially, the R2 will
see how strong of a correlation there is (if any) with the line of best
fit compared to the actual values. Based on the R Squared Values below,
rain would have the strongest correlation to height of the four independent
variables listed.
